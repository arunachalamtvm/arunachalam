<p>Annamalaiyar Temple is a Tamil Hindu temple dedicated to the deity Shiva, located at the base of Annamalai hills in the town of Thiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu, India.</p>
<p> It is significant to the Hindu sect of Saivism as one of the temples associated with the five elements, the Pancha Bhoota Stalas, and specifically the element of fire, or Agni. </p>
<p>Shiva is worshiped as Annamalaiyar or Arunachaleswarar, and is represented by the lingam, with his idol referred to as Agni lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Unnamulai Amman.[1][2] The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam.</p>
<p> The 9th century Saiva saint poet Manikkavasagar composed the Tiruvempaavai here.</p>
<p>The temple complex covers 10 hectares, and is one of the largest in India.[3] It houses four gateway towers known as gopurams.</p>
<p> The tallest is the eastern tower, with 11 stories and a height of 66 metres (217 ft), making it one of the tallest temple towers in India.</p>
<p>[3] The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Annamalaiyar and Unnamulai Amman being the most prominent.</p>
<p> The temple complex houses many halls; the most notable is the thousand-pillared hall built during the Vijayanagar period.</p>
<p>The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar. The Karthigai Deepam festival is celebrated during the day of the full moon between November and December, and a huge beacon is lit atop the hill.</p><p> It can be seen from miles around, and symbolizes the Shiva lingam of fire joining the sky.[4] The event is witnessed by three million pilgrims.</p>
<p> On the day preceding each full moon, pilgrims circumnavigate the temple base and the Annamalai hills in a worship called Girivalam, a practice carried out by one million pilgrims yearly.[3][4][5]</p>
